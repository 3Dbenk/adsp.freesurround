FreeSurround is meant to be the KODI equivalent of your hi-fi receiver's Dolby ProLogic II button (except that it uses a
different algorithm).

It's purpose is to decode surround information from your stereo music (including mp3, of course), and to produce
multichannel output from it. 

It works with any stereo music containing surround info in a coding scheme compatible with any the following decoders:

- Dolby Surround
- Dolby ProLogic
- Dolby ProLogic II
- SRS CircleSurround
- SRS CircleSurround II
- DTS Neo:6
- Lexicon Logic7
- Stereo Quadrophonic (SQ)
- Quadrophonic Stereo (QS)
